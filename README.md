[![Build Status](https://multicoredev.it/buildStatus/icon?job=MultiLucky)](https://multicoredev.it/job/MultiLucky/)

## Description

This plugin allows you to add different types of LuckyBlocks on your server.
You can choose what LuckyBlock features, and messages you want to use from the config.yml.

##### The LuckyBlocks currently available are:
- ##### LuckyBlock (normal)
- ##### LuckyBlock Vip

You can customize for each type of LuckyBlock its corresponding block, the name of this type, its drops with the related name, the command to execute, the chance that happens when the blocks come broken, and the name of correspondent reward from blocks.yml.
